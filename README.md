# Watching-Discord
### WARNING: THIS EXTENSION IS A WIP, REPORT BUGS IN THE ISSUES SECTION.

This is a browser extension (and server) wich shows the video you are watching on your discord profile via it's RPC.

#### Instalation:

To install the extension you'll need to clone the repo as following:

`git clone --recusive https://github.com/BeeCodingOfc/watching-discord.git && cd watching-discord/`

Then, install all the server's dependencies:

`npm install`

After installing the dependencies, you are ready to go. You'll have to load the unpacked extension located in `/extension/<browsername>` (all extensions will be avaliable in the browser's extensions section soon).

Now that you've loaded your extension, just run the server with `node index.js` and open a youtube video to see if it worked!
